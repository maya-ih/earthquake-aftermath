# earthquake-aftermath
We analyzed fictional data on earthquake intensity and aftermath in St. Himark to identify which areas of the city are in greatest need of recovery efforts. The data includes reports of earthquake damage on essential infrastructure around the city using a scale from 1 (no damage) to 10 (severe damage). After performing data wrangling, we created and interpreted five interactive visualizations using Altair and Plotly in Python to pinpoint which parts of the city emergency responders should prioritize.

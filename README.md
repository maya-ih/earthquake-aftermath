# earthquake-aftermath
After a devastating earthquake in St. Himark, we analyzed fictional data on earthquake intensity and aftermath to identify which areas of the city are in greatest need of recovery efforts. The data, which was collected through an app, includes reports of earthquake damage on essential infrastructure around the city using a scale from 1 (no damage) to 10 (severe damage). We created and interpreted five interactive visualization to pinpoint which parts of the city emergency responders should prioritize.

# earthquake-aftermath
After a devastating earthquake in St. Himark, we analyzed fictional data on earthquake intensity and aftermath to identify which areas of the city are in greatest need of recovery efforts. The data includes reports of earthquake damage on essential infrastructure around the city using a scale from 1 (no damage) to 10 (severe damage). After performing data wrangling, we created and interpreted five interactive visualizations to pinpoint which parts of the city emergency responders should prioritize.
